# R Script

Data analyses and figures were generated using the script in `teleology_and_generics.Rmd`. `cache` contains the bayesian models that were run for experiments 2 and 3. To reproduce all analyses and figures, simply fork the repository, open `teleology_and_generics.Rproj` in RStudio, load `teleology_and_generics.Rmd` and click `run all`.
